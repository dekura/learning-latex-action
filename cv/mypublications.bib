    abstract = {Continuous scaling of the VLSI system leaves a great challenge on manufacturing and optical proximity correction (OPC) is widely applied in conventional design flow for manufacturability optimization. Traditional techniques conducted OPC by leveraging a lithography model and suffered from prohibitive computational overhead, and mostly focused on optimizing a single clip without addressing how to tackle the full chip. In this paper, we present DAMO, a high performance and scalable deep learning-enabled OPC system for full chip scale. It is an end-to-end mask optimization paradigm which contains a Deep Lithography Simulator (DLS) for lithography modeling and a Deep Mask Generator (DMG) for mask pattern generation. Moreover, a novel layout splitting algorithm customized for DAMO is proposed to handle the full chip OPC problem. Extensive experiments show that DAMO outperforms the state-of-the-art OPC solutions in both academia and industrial commercial toolkit.},

    abstract = {As the feature size of advanced integrated circuits keeps shrinking, resolution enhancement technique (RET) is utilized to improve the printability in the lithography process. Optical proximity correction (OPC) is one of the most widely used RETs aiming at compensating the mask to generate a more precise wafer image. In this paper, we put forward a level-set based OPC with high mask optimization quality and fast convergence. In order to suppress the disturbance of the condition fluctuation in lithography process, we propose a new process window-aware cost function. Then, a novel momentum-based evolution technique is adopted, which demonstrates substantial improvement. Moreover, graphics processing unit (GPU) is leveraged for accelerating the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on ICCAD 2013 benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms all previous OPC algorithms in terms of both solution quality and runtime overhead. }
